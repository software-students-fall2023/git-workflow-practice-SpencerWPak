# My Interesting Article : [My Worst Tech Interview Experience](https://hbr.org/2021/07/career-crush-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-software-engineer).
As someone who is going into the professional world in the near future, this article gave me a little insight into the real world. I did not really know what the average day as a software developer entails. This article gives me the day to day of the life and helped me understand what a job would look like. The article also gives me information on the interview process and how it runs. While I knew that interviews often included technical assesments, it also refered a book called Cracking the Coding Interview which I found interesting and wanted to check out. It further recommended to start studying long before even an interview was set which is something I should ideally start doing. I also did not know of pair programming interviews where you work on a problem together with another individual. This article gave me useful insight and information that I will use when hunting for a job.
